# Python Pomodoro-Timer 
## This is a pretty basic but relatively nice looking Pomodoro Timer.

Currently its set to a very basic mode, but the funcationality is there (to the most part)





Currently Program is in Debug mode (Also unfinished) so;
- Only a few seconds inbetween Timers
- Spams to console for each tick (Second)
- Pause Button doesn't currently work. (All other do)
- May have some bugs

This was developed on Linux, Using Python3, with PIL Image and PIL ImageTk.
Tomato Image Graphic was obtained from a royalty free website (if there is a  conflict/ copywrite issue please let me know)
